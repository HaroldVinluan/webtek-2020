                    <h2>Family History</h2>
                <p>
                     I came from a poor family, literally started from the bottom. My parents doesn't have college degree. I have 3 brothers and I'm the youngest. The oldest is 29yrs old, then the 2nd is 24yrs old, the 3rd is 23yrs old and I'm 21yrs old. We're from Bataan. Both of my parents are from Orani Bataan.

                    <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p> When i was 4yrs old, I went to Kinder Garden school Orani Bataan for my Preparation. For my primary, I went to Orani South Elementary School since Grade 1 to Grade 6. When i was in Grade 3, I joined Boyscout of the Philippines, until my 6th Grade. And in my 4th 5th and 6th Grade, I played for our school as a Table Tennis player. I graduated with an honor, as Top 8. 
                <br>
                <br>
                 After that, for my secondary, I am from Bataan Peninsula State University(BPSU). Still a player of Table Tennis. Represents the BPSU in SQUAA league(inter State Universities). I graduated in BPSU with an honor, as Top 6. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Then for my Tertiary, I've attended a lot of entrance exams. SLU, UP, PUP, and UST. One of the reason why i entered SLU is, my brothers are here. And of course, the quality. I took BSECE for my !st year in SLU. Then after a year, I shifted in BSIT, why? because the ECE changed their curriculum. I really am interested with the field of Networks and Communication stuffs. But of course, college wasn't that easy for me specially i need to sacrifice things for my family. I need to prioritize them. Encountered financial problems, and personal problems with my family, until i need to sacrifice my studies. After 1year in BSIT, I stopped for 1 1/2 year. That was like 3 sems. So now I'm here again. now I am irregular BSIT - 3.
