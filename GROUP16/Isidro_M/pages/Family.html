		<p>May 22, 2018, My brother's wedding, it was one of the most memorable moments in my life, not only because my brother was offically married to a very beautiful woman, <br>It was also the only family picture we had after how many years. We're a broken family, but it does not stop us from supporting each other, caring for each other. from time <br>to time we do visit each other, it was hard at first, but sulking over the past over and over again will get us nowhere so we decided to adapt and overcome, as of now, 2019,<br> we're happy and contended on what we have. For me, we're still a happy family it may not be as a whole, but, I know we found our happiness back. Though my father and mother<br> will attend any major event that me or my brother will be a part in, for example Graduations to High School Prom or any milestone that me and my brother reach in our life.</p>
